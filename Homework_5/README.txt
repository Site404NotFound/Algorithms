***** COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS *****
The Activity Selection Last-to-Start Implementation algorithm was written in Python,
so no compilation is required before execution.  The program can be executed with the command below.
To execute the program you will need to specify a file name to read in addition to the program's
name.

$ python wrestling.py <file_name>

Alternatively, you could make the file executable and run it with the
instructions below.

$ chmod +x wrestling.py
$ ./wrestling.py <file_name>
